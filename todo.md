Items brought over:
- More discussion on Jester needed!
- Allow the host/admin of the game to decide everyone's roles, then when game starts, put host into spectator mode (not important)
- Configure permission manager to disable whispering for players
- Remove piglin brutes (optional)
- New goal: Find and kill a Warden (1.19)
- Set PlayerSleepPercentage (1.17)
- Update to 1.17

New items to fix:
- 

New suggestions:
- Change Jester so that The Hunters believe the Jester to be on their team, however, they know that one of their teammates is actually the Jester. The Jester does not see who the hunters are, and the Jester's goal is to win with the runners. The Jester is given a dummy compass.
- Make Spectators teleport menu show all runners (hint: use tracking IDs)

Unsure if I should add these in:
- Jester now takes role of player they kill
- Making any further changes to the Jester in general

Issues unable to replicate:
- Fix the hunter's compass (all runner names show on compass and compass list is empty)
- Show hunter's names in compass tracking menu

Issues I can't fix:
Properly determining which team won upon Jester's death (jester/death_by_player)

Issues I won't fix:
- Healer's regeneration is too slow (likely the playtest server was too potato)
- Make compass able to point at Withers around the world

Completed but untested:

Completed and tested:
- Nerf Hunter Strength spell
- Change Hunter's Axe from Netherite to Iron Axe
- Hunter spell error messages are now red instead of aqua
- Fixed healer role could be assigned to a spectator (this has never happened before, so thankfully I spotted this error through the datapack code itself)
- Starter kit wrongly proclaims that participating players cannot claim starter kits as they're a spectator
- Starter kit gives upgraded iron set kit when the End is discovered
- If runners goal is set to Kill the Wither, show all achievements made in the Nether
- Spectators can now teleport to players at random
- Hunters name and coordinates on actionbar do not match. (distance discrepency)
- Hunter's compass stopped working after some runners were eliminated from the game
