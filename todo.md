Items brought over:
- More discussion on Jester needed!
- Allow the host/admin of the game to decide everyone's roles, then when game starts, put host into spectator mode (not important)
- Configure permission manager to disable whispering for players
- Remove piglin brutes (optional)
- New goal: Find and kill a Warden (1.19)
- Set PlayerSleepPercentage (1.17)
- Update to 1.17

New items to fix:
- Figure out what happened when the 2 hunters and Jester killed each other last round
- Fix the hunter's compass (all runner names show on compass and compass list is empty)

New suggestions:
- I think we should change Jester possibly so that if they choose to kill someone, the jester becomes eliminated and whoever they kill survives OR we could have it so that whoever they kill they also become their role (quadmoo)
- When a Jester kills someone it may be a good idea for them to die and the jester to take their role (quadmoo)
- Reduce duration of Hunter's strength spell to 5s (BlueMystery)
- Have the Jester join the opposite team of the player who killed them (BlueMystery)

Unsure if I should add these in:
- Jester now takes role of player they kill

Completed but untested:
- Added redundent code to check when Jester dies if there's only one side (hunters or runners) remaining (jester/death_by_player)

Completed and tested:
- Runners POV when /spell is typed, todo: remove the yellow text
- Increase wither skull drop rate (optional)
- increase repair cost to (Hunter's?) axe and bow to stop cheating
- Changed Jester description
- Edited resetconfirm.mcfunction
- Compass does not update when set to track nearest runner. (Happens when only the Jester is alive so far)
- Make starter kits not redeemable to players in spectator mode (or even better, not show the text once they're out of the game)
