Items I don't plan on making or fixing (but you can feel free to create a pull request!)
- Allow the host/admin of the game to decide everyone's roles, then when game starts, put host into spectator mode
- Starter kit message spams player chat when player is dead

Items I plan on implementing in the future
- Removing the Jester from this datapack
- Configure permission manager to disable whispering for players (this is a server site thing, see https://github.com/zymsbgt/hunters-among-speedrunners-server
- Remove piglin brutes
- New goal: Find and kill a Warden (1.19)
- Set PlayerSleepPercentage (1.17)

Suggestions from players:
- Change Jester so that The Hunters believe the Jester to be on their team, however, they know that one of their teammates is actually the Jester. The Jester does not see who the hunters are, and the Jester's goal is to win with the runners. The Jester is given a dummy compass.
- Make Spectators teleport menu show all runners (hint: use tracking IDs)

Unsure if I should add these in:
- Jester now takes role of player they kill
- Making any further changes to the Jester in general
- Make compass able to point at Withers around the world

Issues I can't fix:
- Properly determining which team won upon Jester's death (jester/death_by_player)
