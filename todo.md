Items brought over:
- More discussion on Jester needed!
- Allow the host/admin of the game to decide everyone's roles, then when game starts, put host into spectator mode (not important)
- Configure permission manager to disable whispering for players
- Remove piglin brutes (optional)
- New goal: Find and kill a Warden (1.19)
- Set PlayerSleepPercentage (1.17)
- Update to 1.17

New items to fix:
- 

New suggestions:
- Change Jester so that The Hunters believe the Jester to be on their team, however, they know that one of their teammates is actually the Jester. The Jester does not see who the hunters are, and the Jester's goal is to win with the runners. The Jester is given a dummy compass.
- 

Unsure if I should add these in:
- Jester now takes role of player they kill
- Making any further changes to the Jester in general

Issues unable to replicate:
- Fix the hunter's compass (all runner names show on compass and compass list is empty)
- Show hunter's names in compass tracking menu

Issues I can't fix:
Properly determining which team won upon Jester's death (jester/death_by_player)

Completed but untested:
- 

Completed and tested:
- Runners POV when /spell is typed, todo: remove the yellow text
- Increase wither skull drop rate (optional)
- increase repair cost to (Hunter's?) axe and bow to stop cheating
- Changed Jester description
- Edited resetconfirm.mcfunction
- Compass does not update when set to track nearest runner. (Happens when only the Jester is alive so far)
- Make starter kits not redeemable to players in spectator mode (or even better, not show the text once they're out of the game)
- Added redundent code to check when Jester dies if there's only one side (hunters or runners) remaining (jester/death_by_player)
- Figure out what happened when the 2 hunters and Jester killed each other last round
