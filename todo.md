Items brought over:
- More discussion on Jester needed!
- Allow the host/admin of the game to decide everyone's roles, then when game starts, put host into spectator mode (not important)
- Configure permission manager to disable whispering for players
- Remove piglin brutes (optional)
- New goal: Find and kill a Warden (1.19)
- Set PlayerSleepPercentage (1.17)
- Update to 1.17

New items to fix:
- Healer's regeneration is too slow
- Can you run commands while in spectator mode? If so, code commands to allow spectators to teleport to other players
- Move Runner's Goal out of experimental settings
- Hunter's compass stopped working after some runners were eliminated from the game
- Hint for the above: Check if player coordinates are cleared after they die

- If runners goal is set to Kill the Wither, show all achievements made in the Nether
- Make compass able to point at Withers around the world (optional)
- Hunters name and coordinates on actionbar do not match. (distance discrepency)


New suggestions:
- Change Jester so that The Hunters believe the Jester to be on their team, however, they know that one of their teammates is actually the Jester. The Jester does not see who the hunters are, and the Jester's goal is to win with the runners. The Jester is given a dummy compass.
- 

Unsure if I should add these in:
- Jester now takes role of player they kill
- Making any further changes to the Jester in general

Issues unable to replicate:
- Fix the hunter's compass (all runner names show on compass and compass list is empty)
- Show hunter's names in compass tracking menu

Issues I can't fix:
Properly determining which team won upon Jester's death (jester/death_by_player)
